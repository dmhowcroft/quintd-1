The effective reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Uruguay has been steadily declining since the beginning of the pandemic. The R value represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual. It is calculated by dividing the number of new cases by the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19. A value of 1.0 indicates that each infected person is transmitting the virus to an average of 1.0 other people. Values below 1.0 indicate that the virus is being contained, while values above 1.0 indicate that the virus is spreading rapidly.
The effective reproduction rate (R) of COVID-19 in Grenada has been steadily declining since the beginning of December 2021. The R value is a measure of the number of people who become infected by a single infected person, and it is calculated by dividing the number of new cases by the number of people who have recovered. The R value is an important indicator of the spread of the virus, and a value greater than 1 indicates that the virus is spreading faster than it can be contained. As of December 31, 2022, the R value in Grenada was 0.03, indicating that the virus is spreading at a relatively slow rate.
